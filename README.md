## General Idea
every player starts with a ship. players can have multiple ships. 
world / spacemap (stellaris style) solar systems to jump between and in a solar system the ships are on grids.
Its all about manage your ships. A ship have "space" for tools each tool needs space and energy to work. 
There are 3 general type of ships. 
full bio (zerg style) they involve heal by them self generate energy can consume things and let tools grow need food
full robo artifactal with worker drones need energy for everything no food
ships with a crew, they need food but not that much as bio they need energy but not that much as robo but they need more space for the lifeforms.
You clould not mix ships you have to decide what kind of ship you want to control.
In a soloar system you can fight other ships or npc or mine or go to planets for food and ressources.
there are also stations which are ai controled where you can buy and sell.
Later a player should be able to have own ships. so its going down to be classic 4x think trade build tech etc
